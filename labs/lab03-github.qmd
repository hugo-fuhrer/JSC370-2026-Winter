# Learning Goals

- Download [lab 3 here](https://github.com/JSC370/JSC370-2026/blob/main/labs/lab3/lab03-github.qmd)
- Read in from github and get familiar with a meteorology dataset 
- Plan out how to tackle the objective question
- Step through the EDA "checklist" presented in the class slides
- Make exploratory graphs and maps

# Deliverables

- Complete the code and summaries and upload your .qmd and rendered .html to Quercus

# Lab Description

We will work with similar meteorological data that was presented in lecture. Recall the dataset consists of weather station readings in the contiguous US. 

**The objective of the lab is to find the weather station with the lowest elevation, find out where this location is (make a map), and make a time series plot of temperature at this station.**

# Steps

### 0. Load libraries

Notes: 

- import the necessary libraries
- note setting pandas options for nicer display of the output
- in the yaml above set enabled to true when you want the code to render

```{python}
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option("display.float_format", "{:.2f}".format) 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import geopandas as gpd
import contextily as cx
from IPython.display import display
```


### 1. Read in the data

Connect to github and read in data with pandas.

```{python}
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSC370/JSC370-2026/main/data/met_all_2025.gz"
met = pd.read_csv(...)    
```

### 2. Check the memory size, dataset dimensions, and the header. How many columns, rows are there?

- fill in where there are ...

```{python}
met.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / ...
```

```{python}
met.shape[...]
```

```{python}
met.head
```

Summary:
- add bullets with your summary

### 3. Look at data types of the variables in the dataset.

```{python}
met.info
```

Summary:
- add bullets with your summary

### 4. Take a closer look at the key variables (`temp` and `elev`). 

- Are there missing data in these variables? If so, make sure they are coded correctly. 


```{python}
key_vars = ['temp', 'elev']

met[...].isnull().sum()
```


- Are there any unusual values that look suspicious?


```{python}

minT = met['temp']
maxT = ...

minE = met['elev']
maxE = ...

pring(minT, maxT, minE, maxE)

```

Summary:
- Add your summary here


### 5. Check the data against an external data source and make any other adjustments.

- Check that the range of elevations make sense. Google or ChatGPT is your friend here.
- Fix any problems that arise in your checks.

-
```{python}

met.loc[...] = np.nan
met[['temp']].describe().round(4)
```

Summary:

```{python}
cold_temps = met[met['temp'] ...]

# display data here extract lat and lon and check google
```

Summary:

```{python}

# Fix up data here, remove implausible values

```



## 6. Answer research questions

Remember to keep the initial questions in mind. We want to pick out the weather station with minimum elevation and examine its temperature.

Some ideas for steps: 
1. subset the data for the weather station with minimum elevation
2. look at histograms of temperature
3. make a time series plot (need to create date variable)
4. make a map to see where it is


### 6a. Subset minimum elevation site

```{python}
# Subset data for the weather station with minimum elevation

```

### 6b. Histogram of temperature at minimum elevation site

```{python}
plt.hist(...)
```

### 6c. Create date variable and time series plot

- Look at the time series of temperature at this location. For this we will need to create a date-time variable for the x-axis.

- Summarize any trends that you see in these time series plots.


```{python}
# Create a date variable for min_elev_station
min_elev_station = min_elev_station.copy()
min_elev_station['date'] = pd.to_datetime(
    min_elev_station[...]
)

# Sort by date
min_elev_station = min_elev_station.sort_values('date')

# Create line plot of temperature by date

plt.plot(...)
plt.xlabel()
plt.ylabel()
plt.show()
```

Summarize time series plot:

### 6d. Where is the lowest weather station?

```{python}
station_location = min_elev_station[...].drop_duplicates()

lat = station_location['lat'].iloc[0]
lon = station_location['lon'].iloc[0]
elev = station_location['elev'].iloc[0]

# make elev into GeoDataFrame for mapping
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    {'elevation': [elev]},
    geometry=gpd.points_from_xy([lon], [lat]),
    crs='EPSG:4326'
)

# Convert to Web Mercator for basemap
gdf = gdf.to_crs('EPSG:3857')

# map
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))
gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=300, marker='*', edgecolor='black', linewidth=2, zorder=5)
cx.add_basemap(ax, source=cx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik)
ax.set_xlabel('Longitude')
ax.set_ylabel('Latitude')
ax.set_title(f'Lowest Elevation Station (Elevation: {elev} m)')
plt.show()
```

Summarize where the lowest elevation station is located.
